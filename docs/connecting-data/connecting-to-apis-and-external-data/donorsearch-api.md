Your Atlassian account is your online Atlassian identity that exists independently of the Atlassian products you use. The account includes attributes like your email address and display name.

### Costs

### Rate Limits
The DonorSearch API is limited to 500 API requests per 5 minutes. Once you exceed this limit, calls will return HTTP status `429` and a message telling you that you've been limited.

Also as a means of preventing room "spam", API methods that involve sending messages to rooms or individual people are limited to 30 requests per minute.

## Sample Queries
The following queries are intended to help you get started, and make life simpler querying within your API.

For the following examples, suppose that my DonorSearch API data source was called `mydonorsearchapi` and I want to query an endpoint. The endpoint goes after the DonorSearch data source name:

!!! example "FROM Clause"

    ```sql
    FROM `mydonorsearchapi`.`<ENDPOINT>`
    ```



### Get Board
This board will only be returned if the user has permission to view it.
