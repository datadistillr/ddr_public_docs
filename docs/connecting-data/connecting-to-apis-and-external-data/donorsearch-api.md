## Sample Queries
The following query is intended to help you get started, and make life simpler querying within your API.

For the following example, suppose that my DonorSearch API data source was called `mydonorsearchapi` and I want to query an endpoint. The endpoint goes after the DonorSearch data source name:

!!! example "FROM Clause"

    ```sql
    FROM `mydonorsearchapi`.`<ENDPOINT>`
    ```

### Get Donor Info
After filling in `sampleFirstName`, `sampleLastName`, `sampleState`, and replacing `1234567890` with a valid telephone number, this sample query will return information on donors.

```sql 
SELECT * FROM donor_search.ds
WHERE firstName = 'sampleFirstName' and
lastName = 'sampleLastName' and
homeState = 'sampleState' and
Telephone = '1234567890'
LIMIT 1000
```
