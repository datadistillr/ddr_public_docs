# Monday API

## Creating a Monday account
Set up an account with [Monday][link-1]{target="_blank"}.

### Costs
There are 4 pricing plans:

**Student**
: $0 seat / month.

**Standard**
: $10 seat / month. Total $30 per month.

**Pro**
: $16 seat / month. Total $48 per month.

**Enterprise**
: [Contact Sales][link-2]{target="_blank"}.

### Rate Limits
The API uses a construct called complexity to define the cost of each query made.

monday.com API rate limits are based on the complexity of the queries an app makes in a given time period. There are two limits to keep in mind:

- A single query is limited to 5,000,000 complexity points 
- All queries made must not exceed 10,000,000 points per minute (1M for trial and free accounts) using your API token generated from the Admin section or the Access Tokens section 

## How to Connect DataDistillr to Monday
To set up a data source connect for Monday, you will need to have:

- A [unique name](#name) for your data source connection to be used in queries
- An [API token](#api-key) generated through your Monday.com account

## Sample Queries
The following queries are intended to help you get started, and make like simpler querying within your API.

For the following examples, suppose that my Monday API data source was called `mymondayapi` and I want to query an endpoint. In the `FROM` clause, the endpoint goes after the Monday data source name.

!!! example "FROM Clause"

    ```sql
    FROM `mymondayapi`.`<ENDPOINT>`
    ```

### Items
monday.com items are a core object in the platform. Items are the objects that hold the actual data within the board, to better illustrate this, you can think of a board as a table and an item as a single row in that table.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM `mymondayapi`.`items`
LIMIT 1000
```

### Users
Every user in monday.com is a part of an account (i.e. an organization) and could be a member or a guest in that account.

Querying users returns one or multiple users.


```sql
SELECT * 
FROM `mymondayapi`.`users`
LIMIT 1000
```

### Boards
monday.com boards are where users input all of their data. As such it is one of the core components of the platform, and one of the main objects you will need to be familiar with.

A boardâ€™s structure is composed of rows (called items), groups of rows (called groups), and columns. The data of the board is stored in the items on the board as well as in the updates sections of each item. Each board has one or more owners and subscribers.

Additionally, there are three different board types (main, shareable, private) and each board can have different sets of permissions. Querying boards can return one board, or a collection of boards.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM `mymondayapi`.`boards`
LIMIT 1000
```

### Updates
monday.com updates contain additional notes and information added to items outside their columns. The main form of communication within the platform takes place in the updates section.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM `mymondayapi`.`updates`
LIMIT 1000
```
