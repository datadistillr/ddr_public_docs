|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `synthetics` | public_id       | from_ts<br>to_ts<br>probe_dc | Returns the list of all Synthetic tests. |
| `metrics`    | from            | host<br>tag_filter           | Returns active Metrics list.             |
| `events`     | start<br>end    |                              | This endpoint queries the event stream.  |

## Sample Queries

The following queries are intended to help you get started, and make life simpler querying within your API.

For the following examples, suppose that my Harmonic.ai data source was called `myHarmonic.ai` and I want to query an endpoint. The endpoint goes after the Harmonic.ai data source name:

!!! example "FROM Clause"

    ```sql
    FROM `myHarmonic.ai`.`<ENDPOINT>`
    ```

### Get Synthetics Endpoint

Get the list of all Synthetic tests. This endpoint requires the Harmonic.ai `synthetics_read` authorization scope.

```sql
SELECT * FROM `myHarmonic.ai`.`synthetics`
WHERE public_id = '<PUBLIC_ID>'
LIMIT 1000
```

### Get Metrics Endpoint

Get the list of actively reporting metrics from a given time until now. This endpoint requires the `metrics_read` authorization scope.

```sql
SELECT * FROM `myHarmonic.ai`.`metrics`
WHERE from = '1643111571'
LIMIT 1000
```

### Get Events Endpoint

The event stream can be queried and filtered by time, priority, sources and tags.

```sql
SELECT * FROM `myHarmonic.ai`.`synthetics`
WHERE start=1641071432 AND end=1643521168
LIMIT 1000
```
