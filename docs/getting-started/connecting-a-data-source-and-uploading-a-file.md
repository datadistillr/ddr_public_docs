# ðŸ“‚ Connect a Data Source and Upload a File

The next step in using DataDistillr is to connect data to your project. This tutorial provides a brief overview of
DataDistillr's data connection capabilities. For complete documentation see the section on
[Connecting Data Sources to DataDistillr](../connecting-data/README.md)

### **Create an Upload Data Source**

After creating the project you will be taken to the _Data Sources_ screen in your new project. Click on the green
_Add Data Source_ button as shown below.

![Data Source Screen](<../img/getting-started/data-source-screen.png>)

A screen will appear allowing you to pick the type of data source you want to connect your project to. DataDistillr
supports a wide range of data sources. For now, click _Upload Directory_ as shown below. For complete documentation see
the section on [Uploading Directory Data Sources](../connecting-data/uploading-files.md).

![Select Upload Directory](<../img/getting-started/upload-directory.png>)

Next, create your file upload data source by completing the form below. Optionally, you can pick an icon and icon color for this data source.

![Add File Upload Data Source](<../img/getting-started/add-file.png>)

Congratulations! You now have a file upload data source associated with your project.

### **Upload Data**

Now you are ready to upload data to DataDistillr!
In this tutorial we will be using the following files as an example.

!!! attachment "Dummy Data"
[Dummy Customers-1.xlsx](/img/Dummy Customers-1.xlsx)  
[Dummy Customers-2.xlsx](/img/Dummy Customers-2.xlsx)

Click _next_ to see an area to upload your files. Drag in your files or _Click to Browse_ and select your local files. 

![File Upload screen](<../img/getting-started/file-upload.png>)

If you added a file by accident, use the _X_ to the right of the file name to remove files you do not wish to Upload.
When your files are ready, press _Upload_ and you should see something like the screen below:

Congratulations! Now you are ready to run a data query.
