# ðŸŽ¬ Create Your First Project

DataDistillr is organized around the concept of projects. DataDistillr projects serve as a container for all the pieces
that go into creating value from data. Within a project you can:

- Store datasets
- Write SQL queries
- Take project notes
- Share documentation
- Generate data visualizations
- Chat with your team in real-time

... and more!

To create your first project, click on the _Create Project_ button at the top right of the screen.

### **Name Your Project**

A form will appear allowing you to enter a project name. Optionally, you can include project goals, tags, an icon and an
icon color. If you don't select an icon or color, they will automatically be selected.
