# ðŸŽ¬ Create Your First Project

DataDistillr is organized around the concept of projects. DataDistillr projects are intended to serve as a container for all the pieces that go into creating value from data. Within a project you can store datasets, queries, project notes, documentation, visualizations, and much more. You can even chat with your colleagues in real time.&#x20;

But first, you'll have to create a project. To create your first project, click on the _Create Project_ button at the top of the screen.
